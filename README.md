### Why do I want to apply to symbl.ai?
- Currently, In the course of these few 3 years of Graduation, we have been taught a lot of things. But the practical application of my knowledge will help me know how much have I actually learned. Joining symbl.ai as an "Information Engineer Intern" will gauge where I stand. No better opportunity than this can come my way. I can showcase my talent and prove my skills here, while in turn, I can learn how this industry functions in and out. 

- I want to join this organization because it will give me a platform where I can implement the skills & knowledge I acquired from my education & internship. The responsibilities which come with this position, indeed provide a great opportunity to showcase my talent & give me room to grow. 

- I intend to be a multi-tasker and I have proved in the past that I have been a team player & havenâ€™t ever shown my back to any responsibilities provided to me. I'm looking to gain lots of real-world experience and exposure to new things, and this role seems to offer all of that. It looks like based on the description that I would be learning to use a lot of new tools and have the chance to work with other software engineers and professionals who can help me develop new skills that will benefit me long-term.
